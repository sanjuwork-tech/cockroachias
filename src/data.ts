export const CONTROVERSY_DETAILS = {
  quote: "In 2026, the term \"cockroach\" entered public discourse after remarks made by Chief Justice of India Justice Surya Kant during a court hearing, triggering a nationwide debate. What was intended as criticism was subsequently embraced by many as a symbol of resilience and dissent.",
  source: "CJI Justice Surya Kant, 2026",
  analysis: "At COCKROACH IAS, we choose to focus on the positive symbolism. A cockroach survives where others give up. It adapts. It endures. It persists against overwhelming odds. Many aspirants are told they are not good enough. Many fail Prelims, Mains, or Interviews. Many are underestimated because of their background, language, or financial condition. Yet they continue. Like the cockroach, they survive every setback and return stronger.",
  ourStand: "COCKROACH IAS is therefore not about an insect. It is about the human capacity to persist when the world expects you to quit. Indian civilisation celebrates not those who never fall, but those who rise repeatedly."
